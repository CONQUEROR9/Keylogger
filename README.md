#KeyLogger

Keyloggers are a type of monitoring software designed to record keystrokes made by a user.

Criminals use keyloggers to steal personal or financial information such as banking details, which they can then sell or use for profit. 

However, they also have legitimate uses within businesses to troubleshoot, improve user experience, or monitor employees. 

KeyLogger.py uses the pynput module to record the keystrokes.

The recorded keystrokes are saved to a file called log.txt in the host machine.

To exit the keylogger just press the esc key.

The file Log.txt will be saved automatically for every 20 keys that have been entered.

Feel free to make any required changes.

Check the requirements.txt to install pynput and try it out for yourself :)
